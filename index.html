    <p class="description">
        A croissant is a buttery, flaky, Austrian viennoiserie pastry inspired by the shape of the
        Austrian kipferl but using the French yeast-leavened laminated dough. Croissants are named for their
        historical crescent shape, the dough is layered with butter, rolled and folded several times in succession, then
        rolled into a thin sheet, in a technique called laminating. The process results in a layered, flaky texture,
        similar to a puff pastry. <br>

        Crescent-shaped breads have been made since the Renaissance, and crescent-shaped cakes possibly since
        antiquity but using brioche dough. Kipferls have long been a staple of Austrian, and French bakeries and
        p√¢tisseries. The modern croissant was developed in the early 20th century when French bakers replaced the
        brioche dough of the kipferl with a yeast-leavened laminated dough. In the late 1970s, the development of
        factory-made, frozen, preformed but unbaked dough made them into a fast food that could be freshly baked by
        unskilled labor. The croissant bakery, notably the La Croissanterie chain, was a French response to
        American-style fast food, and as of 2008, 30-40% of the croissants sold in French bakeries and patisseries
        were baked from frozen dough.
